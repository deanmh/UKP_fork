## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask session secret key | `ukp-kickball-secret-key-change-in-production` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `8080` |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode | `false` |

## Data Persistence

**Important**: All data (users, rosters, games, lineups) is stored in the SQLite database located in the `data/` directory.

- When using Docker Compose, the `./data:/app/data` volume mount ensures your data persists across container restarts and redeployments
- **Your admin user and all data will be preserved** when you rebuild and redeploy the container
- To backup your data, simply copy the `data/` folder
- To reset all data, delete the `data/kickball_roster.db` file and the `data/logos/` folder

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using SHA256
- Only the first user can be created through the UI
- For production, set a strong `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Consider using HTTPS (via reverse proxy like nginx)
- The SQLite database is stored in `/app/data` (Docker) or `./data` (local)
